# ECCV18
These are the required codes to reproduce the results of our annonymous submission to ECCV 2018 to the attention of the reviewers.


The dependencies are very very basic NumPy and SciPy packages. Tested on Conda3.


Note that the decoders in SearchTools.py are very suboptimal, e.g.,  using lots of for-loops. So to be used only for demonstration purposes and not valid for run-time measurement.
